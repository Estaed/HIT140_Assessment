# Investigation A: Bat Behavioral Analysis - Do Bats Perceive Rats as Predators?

## üöß **PROJECT STATUS: IN PROGRESS - NOT FINISHED YET**

This project analyzes whether bats perceive rats as potential predators or competitors by examining behavioral patterns, vigilance responses, and using machine learning classification.

## Project Overview
The investigation uses two datasets to analyze bat foraging behavior in the presence of rats:
- **Dataset1**: Individual bat landing events with detailed behavioral analysis
- **Dataset2**: Environmental context from 30-minute observation periods

## File Structure and Current Implementation

### ü§ñ **investigation_A_ml.py** - ML-Enhanced Investigation (MAIN FILE)
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Recently updated with fixed ML classification
- **Purpose**: Complete investigation with machine learning enhancement
- **Key Features**:
  - Uses SVM for competition vs predator classification
  - Separates ambiguous 'bat_and_rat' behaviors into clear categories
  - Vigilance-based training logic (fixed classification issue)
  - Comprehensive statistical analysis with ML-separated categories
- **Phases**:
  - Phase 1: Data Loading and Risk-Reward Analysis
  - Phase 2: Habit Classification and Data Cleaning
  - Phase 3: Smart Imputation for Unknown Values
  - Phase 4: ML Classification (Competition vs Predator)
  - Phase 5: Enhanced Statistical Analysis
  - Phase 6: Final Conclusions with ML Results

### üßÆ **ml_algorithm_comparison.py** - Algorithm Comparison Tool
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Updated with competition/predator terminology
- **Purpose**: Tests and compares ML algorithms for classification
- **Key Features**:
  - Tests 13 different algorithms (KNN, SVM, Random Forest, etc.)
  - Uses competition vs predator terminology (not bat vs rat)
  - Cross-validation performance evaluation
  - **Result**: SVM (Linear) identified as best performer

### üìä **investigation_A.py** - Base Investigation (Legacy)
- **Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Older version without ML enhancement
- **Purpose**: Original investigation without ML classification
- **Note**: Use `investigation_A_ml.py` for most current analysis

## üîÑ **Current Workflow**

### **Recommended Usage:**
1. **Run ML-enhanced version**: `python investigation_A_ml.py`
   - This includes all latest improvements and ML classification
   - Fixes the classification bias issue
   - Uses vigilance-based training for better results

### **Optional Algorithm Testing:**
2. **Test algorithms**: `python ml_algorithm_comparison.py`
   - Compare different ML approaches
   - Validate SVM as best choice

## üéØ **Key Improvements Made**

### **Recently Fixed Issues:**
- ‚úÖ **Classification Bias**: Fixed issue where all bat_and_rat entries were classified as 'predator'
- ‚úÖ **Training Logic**: Switched from risk-reward only to vigilance-based classification
- ‚úÖ **Algorithm Choice**: Updated to use SVM (best performer from comparison)
- ‚úÖ **Terminology**: Consistent use of 'competition' vs 'predator' (clearer than 'bat' vs 'rat')

### **Current ML Approach:**
- **Training Data**: 
  - Competition: Fast approach (vigilance <10s) + success patterns
  - Predator: Cautious approach (vigilance >8s) + risk-taking patterns
- **Classification**: SVM with linear kernel for bat_and_rat entries
- **Feature Set**: Vigilance, timing, risk/reward, environmental factors

## üìà **Expected Results**
The ML classification should now produce:
- Mixed classification of bat_and_rat entries (both competition and predator behaviors)
- More accurate behavioral separation based on vigilance patterns
- Better statistical analysis with properly separated categories

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Still To Do**
- [ ] Feature engineering improvements
- [ ] Statistical analysis refinement
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Final validation and testing
- [ ] Documentation completion

## üöÄ **How to Run**

```bash
# Run the main ML-enhanced investigation
python investigation_A_ml.py

# Optional: Test algorithm comparison
python ml_algorithm_comparison.py
```

## üìÅ **Output Files**
- **Datasets**: `datasets/ml_analysis/` - Cleaned and classified data
- **Plots**: `plots/ml_analysis/` - Visualization results for each phase
- **Algorithm Comparison**: `plots/ml_algorithm_comparison.png`
